Template data files in subdir engineCarData:

<vehName>.carData
<vehName>.engineData
 
copy a pair of them or just the .carData file to

<projName>.carData1
<projName>.engineData1 (optional)

since these are called per default 
(RoadSection.cpp: get_fueldata("1"))

Only .carData1 existing => analytic formula for characteristic map
also .engineData1 existing => use tabulated char map of this file
