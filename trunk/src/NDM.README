Necessary Driving Model (NDM) according to 
Andresen, E., Chraibi, M., Seyfried, A., & Huber, F. (2013,

MObility User Conference (pp. 18-32). Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg. 

The NDM is originally formulated in terms of difference equations for the speed (Andresen et al.,
692014) which, in the limit of update times ÔÅÑt tending to zero, is equivalent to a coupled differential
equation with the acceleration function

dv/dt=(v0-v)/tau * theta(s-d(v)) - min(dec1+dec2, bmax)
d(v)=s0+v*T
dec1=min(0.5*dv^2/(s-s0), bmax)*theta(dv)
dec2=( (s-d(v))/d(v))^2 if (s<=d(v)) AND (dv>0), 0 otherwise
