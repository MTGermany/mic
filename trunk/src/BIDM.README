IDM with Brownian Motion (BIDM)
~/papers/2016_JunFang_stochastic/

includes 2D-IDM and BIDM with speed adaptation

components:

(1) IDM as basic model with T3 as desired time gap

(2) indifference region for s(v,dv) in [sstar(v,dv;T1), sstar(v,dv;T2)

(3) stochasticity in form of Brownian acceleration (not speed!)
    only in the indifference region 

(4) optionally speed adaptation term=FVDM-like sensitivity to dv
    only in the indifference region
